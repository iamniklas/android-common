AndroidCommon is a collection of some widely used implementations for various topics related to the Android library. 
The library covers topics like authentication (login and registration via Firebase with Google-SignIn and Email-SignIn), some common Firebase Services like Firestore and Remote Configuration, and many more.

The repo is far from complete, but it is only maintained for my purposes and my needs. However, feel free to add the dependency to your project if you want to use the library.
For more information about setting up the dependency, click the JitPack badge above.
